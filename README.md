IN PROGRESS == Personal project ==

**The Musician Trainer project is a web application (in the future perhaps even mobile app) designed to assist musicians in their practice routines and musical piece management.**

**The project incorporates various technologies to provide a comprehensive platform for users to organize, track, and enhance their musical training experience.**

# Project Description:
# 1. Objective:
**Training Assistance**: The project aims to help musicians in managing their musical pieces, practice sessions, and progress tracking.

# 2. Key Features:
**Piece Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete musical pieces, including details like name, composer, and priority.

**Practice Logging**: The system records practice sessions, including dates and notes, allowing users to track their training history.

**Dashboard**: Users are presented with a personalized dashboard displaying their pieces, prioritized by importance and practice history.

**User Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures personalized experiences and data privacy.

**User Roles**: Administrative features are available for users with administrative roles.

# 3. Technologies Used:
**Java**: The application is built using Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language.

**Spring Boot**: This framework simplifies the development of Java applications, providing features like dependency injection and MVC architecture.

**Hibernate**: An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework is used for efficient database interactions.

**Thymeleaf**: A modern server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments, integrated with Spring for dynamic HTML rendering.

**MySQL**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing and managing application data.

**OpenAI** Playground API: Integration with OpenAI's language models through the API to enhance the application with natural language processing capabilities.

# 5. Integration with OpenAI Playground API:
**Natural Language Processing**: The integration with OpenAI Playground API enhances the application by allowing users to interact with the system using natural language. This might include features like generating practice recommendations or answering user queries about musical theory.

# 7. User Interface:
**Bootstrap**: The project uses Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

**HTML**/**CSS**: Standard web technologies are employed for creating structured and styled web pages.

# 9. Data Storage:
**MySQL Database**: The project utilizes MySQL for the storage and retrieval of user and musical piece data.

# 11. Security:
**Spring Security**: Ensures secure user authentication and authorization within the application.

# 13. Development Environment:
IDE: The project is developed using **Intellij IDEA**.

# Summary:
The Musician Trainer project combines robust backend technologies with a user-friendly interface to create an efficient and effective tool for musicians.

The integration with OpenAI Playground API brings advanced natural language capabilities to the application, providing users with an enhanced and interactive musical training experience.
